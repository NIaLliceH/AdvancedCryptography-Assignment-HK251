The premise of My Hero Academia is set in a world where the impossible has become the ordinary. It began in Qing Qing City with the birth of a luminescent baby, and soon after, paranormal abilities began to manifest across the globe. These abilities, known as Quirks, eventually spread to eighty percent of the human population. This rapid evolution caused chaos initially, but it eventually gave rise to a new profession that everyone had once only dreamed of: Heroes. In this superhuman society, Pro Heroes are civil servants who maintain order, rescue citizens from disasters, and battle against criminals who use their powers for evil.

The protagonist, Izuku Midoriya, is a rare exception in this world. Born without a Quirk, he faces discrimination and bullying, particularly from his childhood friend Katsuki Bakugo. Despite this, Izuku dreams of becoming a hero like his idol, All Might, the Symbol of Peace. His life changes forever when he meets All Might and discovers the secret of his power: One For All. This unique ability is not innate but transferable, stockpiling power and passing it from one generation to the next. Chosen as the ninth holder, Izuku enrolls in UA High School, the most prestigious hero academy in Japan.

However, a shadow looms over this era of peace. The League of Villains, led by the unstable Tomura Shigaraki and the ancient mastermind All For One, seeks to destroy the current hero society. They believe the system is fragile and false. As Izuku and his classmates in Class 1-A hone their skills, they are forced to grow up quickly. They face not only written exams but life-or-death battles against villains who threaten their friends and families. The story explores themes of legacy, the definition of justice, and what it truly means to go beyond one's limits, embodying the school motto: Plus Ultra.
